# Security Policy

`prompt-provenance-diff-action` reads the prompt-provenance JSON document at the workflow's checkout HEAD, retrieves the previous version via `git show`, posts a single PR comment via the GitHub API (when run on a pull_request event with a valid token), and writes structured outputs. No remote fetch beyond the GitHub API comment call, no execution of user-supplied code.

The action uses `${{ github.token }}` by default — scoped to the repository where the workflow runs and never persisted. If you provide your own token via the `github-token` input, ensure it has only `pull-requests: write` permissions.

The `git show` invocation runs in a sub-shell with stdout-only piping; the previous file content is parsed as JSON without `eval` or `Function()`.
